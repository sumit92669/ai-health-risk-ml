# AI-Based Early Disease Risk Prediction System (Offline)

## 📌 Overview
This project is an offline machine learning-based risk assessment system that estimates the probability of common lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity using basic health parameters.

The system is designed to work entirely offline, ensuring privacy, accessibility, and independence from proprietary APIs.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Multi-disease risk prediction  
✔ Offline-first design (No internet required)  
✔ Risk score computation  
✔ Explainable AI predictions  
✔ Feature importance analysis  
✔ Visual risk indicators  
✔ BMI auto-calculation  

---

## 🧠 Technical Approach

The prediction engine uses:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Risk Score Calculation  
- Feature Importance Analysis  

The system provides interpretable outputs indicating which health parameters contributed most to the prediction.
